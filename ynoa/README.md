# Minesweeper

## Rules
If you find a mine the game is over.

If you find an empty square the game goes on.

If a number shows up will inform how many mines are hidden in the eight closest squares around him. You should use this info to deduct the next safest guess.

## Objectives

Find all numbers on the board without getting exploded. Thats it.
